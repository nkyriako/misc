Hw 2 Problem 4. 

blue = mergesort 
green = insertionsort
red = selectionsort 

Mergesort has the fastest average runtime on a randomized array. It is still theta nlogn and still beats the other two 
sorting algorithms by a long shot, speed-wise. Insertion sort has a big difference between its
best and worst case run time as we have seen from the previous graphs, but the average case still has a theta n^2 
running time so it is the slowest with random inputs. Selection sort has the same run time for best and worst case 
so it also increases similarly to insertionsort, with theta n^2.
