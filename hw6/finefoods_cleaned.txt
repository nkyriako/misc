5: i have bought several of the vitality canned dog food products and have found them all to be of good quality the product looks more like a stew than a processed meat and it smells better my labrador is finicky and she appreciates this product better than  most
1: product arrived labeled as jumbo salted peanutsthe peanuts were actually small sized unsalted not sure if this was an error or if the vendor intended to represent the product as jumbo
4: this is a confection that has been around a few centuries  it is a light pillowy citrus gelatin with nuts  in this case filberts and it is cut into tiny squares and then liberally coated with powdered sugar  and it is a tiny mouthful of heaven  not too chewy and very flavorful  i highly recommend this yummy treat  if you are familiar with the story of cs lewis the lion the witch and the wardrobe  this is the treat that seduces edmund into selling out his brother and sisters to the witch
2: if you are looking for the secret ingredient in robitussin i believe i have found it  i got this in addition to the root beer extract i ordered which was good and made some cherry soda  the flavor is very medicinal
3: this seems a little more wholesome than some of the supermarket brands but it is somewhat mushy and doesnt have quite as much flavor either  it didnt pass muster with my kids so i probably wont buy it again
